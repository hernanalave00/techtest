## Portal-created Resources

The following resources were created manually through the Azure Portal:

- **Azure Function App**: techtest-function
- **Storage Account**: created and linked to the Function App
- **Azure Service Bus Namespace**: techtest-sb123
- **Service Bus Queue**: techtest-sb123-queue

An **App Registration** was also created via Azure CLI and assigned the Key Vault Secrets User role to access secrets stored in the Key Vault.
